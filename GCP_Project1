Cloud Transfer Service
2. Storing Data in Azure Data Lake (Azure Data Lake → Google Cloud Storage)
Azure Data Lake stores raw data in Azure.
GCP Equivalent:
Google Cloud Storage: Object storage for companies of all sizes.
BigQuery: Can also store structured and semi-structured data.
Skills Gained:

Google Cloud Storage
BigQuery for querying data
3. Data Transformation (Azure Databricks → Google Cloud Dataproc or Google Cloud Dataflow)
Azure Databricks is a data engineering and machine learning platform using Spark.
GCP Equivalent:
Google Cloud Dataproc: A managed Spark and Hadoop service.
Google Cloud Dataflow: Can also be used for transformations.
Skills Gained:

Google Cloud Dataproc
